# CyberGen (CypherCity) — Web Demo

- https://kayden-plemons.github.io/CyberGen-Web-Demo/ 

This repository hosts the public **web demo build** of CyberGen, an IT Capstone project developed by Team CyberGen.

CyberGen is a cybersecurity awareness game that combines city-building mechanics with interactive training scenarios to help users recognize social engineering threats.

> ⚠️ This repository contains the compiled web demo only.  
> The main development repository is private.

## About the Project

CyberGen turns cybersecurity education into an interactive experience. Players build and manage a digital city while responding to training prompts based on real-world phishing, scam, and social engineering tactics.

The goal is to reinforce safe decision-making through repetition, feedback, and in-game rewards.

## Problem Being Addressed

Many users struggle to recognize:

- Phishing emails  
- Scam text messages  
- Social engineering tactics  
- Malicious links and impersonation attempts  

CyberGen helps improve awareness by presenting short, repeated decision-based scenarios within a game environment.

## Target Audience

- University students  
- Individuals vulnerable to phishing or scam attempts  
- Users interested in improving cybersecurity awareness

## Web Demo

This repository automatically builds and deploys the Flutter Web version of the app using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

Each push to the main development branch triggers:

1. A secure build pipeline  
2. Flutter Web compilation  
3. Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages  

The demo reflects the current state of the project’s main branch.
